## Sketchbook Entry: Electron

This project is a sketchbook (or playground, or scratch space, or whatever your favorite term is for NOT A REAL PRODUCT) for understand Electron. It is meant to be reference for get up and running as quickly as possible, including both the Electron recommended setup and my own opinionated ways of working.

Nothing is gauranteed to work properly. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mbw-sketchbook/skb-electron/wiki) for more detailed documentation on how this project evolves.
